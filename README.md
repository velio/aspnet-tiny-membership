Have In Mind 
Because of the tiny data storages, it is not recommended to use this providers with "heavy-duty" membership sites (a lot of roles, users and big number of members).  
Tiny Membership Providers best fit for sites with small number of authenticated users and hosted on servers with no SQL access.
